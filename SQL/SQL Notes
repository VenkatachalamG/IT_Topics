# SQL Notes

## 📘 Definition of SQL

*SQL (Structured Query Language)* is used to **communicate with databases**.

- Helps retrieve, insert, update, and delete data  
- Acts as a bridge between user/application and the database

---

## ❓ Why Use a Database?

- Can store **huge amounts of data**  
- **More secure** than file storage  
- **Fast and efficient** data storage and retrieval

---

## 💾 DBMS (Database Management System)

Software that:

- Handles all requests to a database from various sources  
- Manages the **priority** of requests  
- Ensures proper **execution** and data access  

---

## 🖥️ What is a Server?

- **Powerful machines** available *24/7*  
- They **host databases**  
- Can be **physical** or hosted on a **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)**

---

## 🗃️ Types of Databases

### 1. Relational

- Tables with **rows and columns**
- Tables can relate to each other using **keys**
- SQL-based

### 2. Key-Value

- Stores data in **key–value pairs** (like a dictionary)
- Fast for **simple lookups**

### 3. Column-Based

- Groups data by **columns**
- Efficient for **large datasets and analytics**

### 4. Graph

- Stores **relationships** between data
- Best for **networks**, **recommendations**

### 5. Document

- Stores data as **documents** (e.g., JSON, BSON)
- Schema-less and flexible

### 🔍 Examples:

| Type       | Example DBs                         |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Relational | Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL           |
| Key-Value  | Redis, Amazon DynamoDB              |
| Column     | Apache Cassandra, Amazon Redshift   |
| Graph      | Neo4j                               |
| Document   | MongoDB                             |

## 🧱 Database Hierarchy

```pgsql
SERVER
  └── DATABASES
       └── SCHEMAS (e.g., TEACHERS, STUDENTS)
            └── TABLES
                 └── ROWS & COLUMNS
